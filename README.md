# 🛡️ Supercharge Your Comodo WAF with StopBadBots Custom Rules

> **Important:** These rules are designed **exclusively** to work with and enhance the **Comodo WAF** rule set.  
> They are **not** a standalone firewall and should not be used without Comodo's core rules already in place.

The default **Comodo WAF** is a strong foundation for web security.  
However, many modern threats are **behavior-based**, involving bots that scan, probe, and attempt brute-force attacks.  
This custom ruleset from **StopBadBots** adds **proactive protection** to stop these threats **before** they can cause harm.

---

## 🚀 1. Why Add These Rules?

Adding our rules to your Comodo WAF provides:

✅ **Proactive Brute-Force Protection** — Detects and blocks IPs with multiple failed WordPress login attempts.  
✅ **Intelligent Scanner Detection** — Blocks bots causing too many 404 errors (vulnerability scans).  
✅ **Reduced Server Load** — Stops bad bots before they trigger heavy PHP/database processes.  
✅ **Real-World Tested** — Based on real traffic analysis from high-traffic websites.
